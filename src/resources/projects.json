At Bekk I got to work as a consultant for Wenn, an AI startup with many AI projects related to car insurance. At Wenn I worked as a data scientist, providing Wenn with insight for improving their models. I also attended many courses and events with Bekk where I learned a lot about the life of an IT-consultant. Concepts such as agile, customer-relations and teamworks were central in this internship.",

While I worked there I did mainly testing and customer service, as I did not have much software engineering experience yet. This also involved on-site support, fixing and setting up the Raspberry Pi's which were running in the stores. I also did some scripting for the Raspberry Pi's and some backend programming in Java/Spring Boot on a rewrite of the backend for the queue-software.",

The app was programmed in Kotlin and used libraries like Jetpack and Retrofit. We also used many Google Firebase services, like FireStore, Authentication and Cloud Storage.
